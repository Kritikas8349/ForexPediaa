          that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-personal Identification Information</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>Web Browser Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Our Site may use “cookies” to enhance the User experience. User’s web browser places cookies
          on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them.
          Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
          If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.
